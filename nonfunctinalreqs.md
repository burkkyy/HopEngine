# Non functional requirements
Requirements for this project depend almost entirely on whether the user intends to build the project from source, or run the binary.

If the user runs the binary, the program will require a GPU from either Intel, Nvidia, or AMD produced within the last 5 years. 

Building the project from source requires more specific resources.   
See [system requirements](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/#system-requirements) for more.
As long as these system requirements are met and docker is able to run, the project can be built from source.
