## Design Overview  
Below is our context diagram, which describes how elements within our system interact with one-another. As the most complex subsystem, a data-flow diagram (DFD) for the graphics engine is provided in the logical design section.

## Logical Design  

 The Hop Engine is composed of the following components:  

### API  
Provides functions and classes that the user will use to create their game. The API is connected to the other components and the user in the following ways:  
* The API provides functions and classes used in window/context generation, playing sound, processing keyboard input, and loading images.  

* The API's functions and classes can be used by the user when developing a game using the Hop Engine.  

### Audio
Load audio files and allow users to play them. The sound is connected to the other components in the following ways:  

* The sound is played with help from the API.

### Input 
Process keyboard and mouse input from player and relay it to user. The input is connected to the other components in the following ways:  

* The mouse and keyboard input is processed with help from the API.  

### Window/Context Generation 

Create a valid window and rendering context on the user's system. Window/context generation is connected to the other components in the following ways:  

* The window/context generation is done with help from API functions/classes.  

* The window provides a space for the graphics engine to generate images/text. 

### Image Processing  

Load textures and other image assets so they are available to the user. Image loading is connected to the other components in the following ways:  

* Images are loaded with help from API functions/classes.

* The graphics engine displays the loaded images on screen. 

### Graphics Engine 

Render two-dimensional graphics by converting and relaying user code to the GPU. Used to generate images and text on screen according to the user's specifications. The graphics engine is connected to the other components in the following ways:  

* Graphics are displayed in a window.  

* Loaded images are displayed by the graphics engine.

### Data Management
As our engine is geared towards the development of small games by beginner and intermediate programmers, data storage will be limited. Asset files, such as textures and sound files, will be stored in designated directories as described above. Otherwise, all data and instructions will be contained within project source files and will not persist once the application is closed. 

### Interfaces

In this section we have provided a summary of the public interfaces for each component of our project. Since our application is itself a library, public interfaces for each component take the form of C++ classes, functions, and data types.
