# Version Control

## GitHub

Our team will use GitHub to manage the version control of our project. We have created a central repository called HopHopEngine that all of the team members have cloned. Each team member has created their own dev branch to work from in their name, and will merge to the main branch when significant changes have been made.

## Pushing to Repo

When each group member is ready to push from their cloned copy to the repo, the protocol is to first pull from the repository to ensure their local copy is up to date before sending a message on discord that they're ready to push. To limit issues with merging to main, each team member will ensure to push after changing no more than 5-10 files. In addition, team members will ensure to regularly pull from main throughout the development process to keep their branch updated. 

After being notified, Caleb and/or Indigo will let the team member know if it's okay to push their changes. If approval is given to push their changes, the team member will execute the push before going to GitHub in their browser to create a pull request to initiate the merge of their dev branch to main. The repository is set up in such a way that 2 approvals are required by Caleb and Indigo before the merge is conducted so as to ensure total approval of the changes and little opportunity for conflicting pushes.
