# Project Update


No past documents were changed this phase, however the changes that we said we made to the specifications document have been pushed to the main branch. (Apologies for the lack of commit last week, I (jake) was under the impression Glen was going to commit it and Glen was under the impression I was going to. It's there now.)

Currently, we are in the process of reworking how users will interface with the engine by writing a new API that will be much more user friendly and abstract away a large amount of the complexity in the current API (engine.hpp). This will lead to changes for our documents, however since we have not completed it's implementation at this poing we will update the relevant parts of our documents for phase 6.
