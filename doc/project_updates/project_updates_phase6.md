## Project Update - Phase 6

The UserManual.md file is entirely new for this phase (obviously).
We made significant updates to our specifications document to reflect the final state of the project. They were spread throughout the entire document. 
We also updated our Version Control document by removing some content that was no longer relevant. 
We made changes to the file tree in the design.md document and fixed the input parameter names in the window subsection.

Generally the functionality we got implemented lined up closely with that we expected to achieve.
