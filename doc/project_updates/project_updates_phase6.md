## Project Update - Phase 6

The UserManual.md file is entirely new for this phase (obviously).
We updated our specifications document to reflect the final state of the project.
We also updated our Version Control document by removing some content that was no longer relevant. 
We made changes to the file tree in the design.md document and fixed the input parameter names in the window subsection.

Generally the functionality we got implemented lined up very closely with that we expected to achieve. The parts that we hoped to implement like textures were always stretch goals so they were not reflected in our documentation.
