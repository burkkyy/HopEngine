# Project Updates
# Team Roles & Responsibilities
- Calebâ€™s role was initially understood to be more hands-on, but we have all agreed to make him more of a CTO, or director. He will direct us in the development of the engine instead of mainly programming (most of the time).
- We have changed the rules around pushing to main so that *either* Indigo or Caleb can approve requests. Before, both had to approve.

# Major Changes
- Name change for the engine: we are now calling it Hop.
- "Demo" for our project will _definitely_ include a rabbit and other objects such as a carrot. Additionally, there will probably be rudimentary game physics.
 - Git repo has been modified, under the advice of Dave, to include a "dev" branch that we will push to for testing purposes, before finally pushing to main.
