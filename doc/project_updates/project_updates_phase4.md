# Project Update

The design.md document was rewritten in it's entirety to be more readable and contain clearer information.
The most significant changes are in the overall structure of the document as well as the design overview and the logical design sections.

The specifications.md document was also updated to reflect the current state of our project. 
Added information about the engine class, as well as the sound class. Also added the sections:

void Engine::bind(const char* key name,void (*Ptr)()) (function)

void Engine::play_sound(Sound) (function)

The core structure of the project has not changed, the documents have been updated to reflect the changes that occured in making our project acheive what was intended.
